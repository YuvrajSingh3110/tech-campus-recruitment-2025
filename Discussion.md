# Log Extraction Solution Discussion

## Solutions Considered-

1. **Full File Extraction Approach**
   - Extract entire zip file and then process
   - Pros: Simple implementation, direct file access
   - Cons: Requires ~1TB disk space, not feasible for most systems

2. **Streaming from Zip**
   - Process zip content directly in chunks without extraction
   - Pros: Minimal disk space (~664MB), memory efficient
   - Cons: Slightly more complex implementation

3. **Database Import Approach**
   - Extract and import into database with indexing
   - Pros: Fast queries after import
   - Cons: Requires large disk space, complex setup

4. **Memory-Mapped Files**
   - Use memory mapping for file access
   - Pros: System-level memory management
   - Cons: Platform dependent, requires extraction

5. **Distributed Processing**
   - Split processing across multiple machines
   - Pros: Handles large files, faster processing
   - Cons: Complex infrastructure, overkill for requirement

## Final Solution Summary

We chose the **Streaming from Zip** approach with chunk-based processing:

1. **Why This Approach?**
   - Space Efficient: Only requires space for zip file (~664MB)
   - Memory Efficient: Processes data in small chunks (1MB)
   - Reliable: Works consistently regardless of file size
   - Practical: No special infrastructure needed

2. **Key Features**:
   - Downloads zip file from Google Drive
   - Streams content directly from zip without extraction
   - Processes data in configurable chunks
   - Shows progress during processing
   - Memory-efficient line matching
   - Detailed error handling

3. **Technical Details**:
   - Uses `gdown` for Google Drive downloads
   - Implements `zipfile` for direct zip processing
   - Chunk-based processing with buffer management
   - UTF-8 encoding with error handling
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations

## Steps to Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   # Install required package
   pip install gdown
   ```

2. **System Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - ~700MB free disk space (for zip file and output)
   - Internet connection (for first download)

3. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   project_root/
   ├── src/
   │   └── extract_logs.py
   └── output/
       ├── logs.zip (downloaded, ~664MB)
       └── output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt (results)
   ```

4. **Running the Script**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project root
   cd project_root

   # Run script with date argument
   python src/extract_logs.py 2024-12-01
   ```

5. **Expected Output**:
   - First run: Downloads zip file from Google Drive
   - Processes logs for specified date
   - Shows progress (lines processed and matches found)
   - Creates output file with matching entries
   - Displays completion message with statistics

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles download failures
   - Manages file access errors
   - Provides clear error messages
   - Graceful handling of invalid dates

## Performance Characteristics

- Download: One-time ~664MB download
- Processing: Streams in 1MB chunks
- Memory Usage: Minimal, independent of file size
- Disk Space: Requires only zip file space (~664MB)

## Future Improvements

1. Add date format validation
2. Implement multi-threading for chunk processing
3. Add checksum verification for downloads
4. Create index for frequently accessed dates
5. Add compression options for output files
